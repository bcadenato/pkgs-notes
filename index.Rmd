# Notes for writing packages in R {-}

This book tries to collect some of the tips that I usually forget from time to time when I write a package. It's not intended to be comprehensive in any way, and it's only for my personal use. 

At the same time, this is the first book I build using `bookdown`, and it's a test on its concepts, and a way of trying its ideas for practical use.
